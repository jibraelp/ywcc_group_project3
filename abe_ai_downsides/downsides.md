Types of AI used in the hotel industry:

Analytical AI: used to predict busy and low seasons for the hotels, using the data to maximize revenue.

Chatbots: Hotels use AI-powered chatbots to handle customer inquiries, provide information, and help with bookings, often through social media or their own websites.

Personalization: AI algorithms analyze guest preferences and data to provide personalized recommendations for room selection, dining options, and local attractions.

Facial recognition: Some hotels use AI-powered facial recognition systems for check-in, check-out, and security purposes.

Housekeeping and maintenance: AI can predict when rooms will need cleaning or when equipment requires maintenance, improving efficiency and reducing costs



- People sometimes get frustrated with technology because it canâ€™t handle certain niche requests
- It feels less personal to interact with a machine than another human being
- For things such as facial recognition, it requires you to trust the hotel with biometric data which can make people uncomfortable
- Initial financial investment can be high in the hospitality / hotel industry
- Possibility for it to be fed / trained on bad data, making it perform worse (where as if a human makes a mistake, it is easy to correct it an AI will take much longer to learn a correction)
